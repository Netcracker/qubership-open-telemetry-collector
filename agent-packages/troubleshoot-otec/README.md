# troubleshoot-otec

A single user-invoked skill that diagnoses problems with Qubership OpenTelemetry Collector (a custom OpenTelemetry
Collector distribution that ingests traces over OTLP, Jaeger, and Zipkin, derives span metrics, and exports to Jaeger,
Prometheus, and Graylog).

The skill is **read-only and advisory**. It does not run `kubectl`, SSH, or Ansible, and it never changes a system. It
reads a pasted problem description plus any attached logs or configuration, matches the symptom against a curated
reference, and returns a diagnosis with remediation steps and a list of data to collect when the match is uncertain.
